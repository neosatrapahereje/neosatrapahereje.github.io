# Fun Ways of Wrinting Pi (Pi Day 2020)

$$\pi$$ is arguably the most (in)famous number.

<!-- Even our cat is named after pi! -->

Here are three fun ways of representing pi.

1. $$\pi = 4 \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{1 - x^2} dx$$

	<!-- We start with an integral representation. -->


	<!-- From basic high school geometry we know that the equation in Cartesian coordinates for a circle with radious $$r$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ centered at the origin is given by -->

	<!-- $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$$ -->

	<!-- We can solve this equation for $$y$$, which results in -->

	<!-- $$y(x) = \pm \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$$ -->

	<!-- We know that the area of the circle can be computed as a function of its radius as -->

	<!-- $$A = \pi r^2$$ -->

	<!-- Using that the definite integral represents the area under the curve $$y(x)$$, we can rewrite the area of the circle in terms of $$y(x)$$ as -->

	<!-- $$A = \pi r^2=4 \int_{0}^{r} \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}dx$$ -->

	<!-- The identity follows trivially by doing $$r=1$$ ;-) -->
	
	<!-- We can check this numerically: -->
	
	<!-- ```python -->
	<!-- import numpy as np -->
	<!-- import scipy.integrate as integrate -->
	
	<!-- # Integrand -->
	<!-- def f_x(x): -->
	<!-- 	return np.sqrt(1 - x**2) -->
		
	<!-- # Perform numerical integration -->
	<!-- integral = integrate.quad(f_x, 0, 1)[0] -->
	
	<!-- # Compute the identity -->
	<!-- pi_hat = 4 * integral -->
	
	<!-- print(pi_hat, np.pi, abs(pi_hat - np.pi)) -->
	<!-- ``` -->

2. $$ \pi = 2 \int_{0}^{1} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} $$

3. $$ \pi = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n - 1}(n!)^2(2n+1)}$$
